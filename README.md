# Reggaeton
Creating Awareness around Latin Music
Reggaeton Mundo is an interactive report that allows users to view detailed song,
album, and artist information in the Latin music Genre, Reggaeton.
I used SQL Server 2019 on the back-end to manually build my database,
and SSRS on the front-end to build the report.
I also used Canva to create the dynamic images for buttons, and backgrounds.
I created this project to create awareness around music in the Latin culture.
This music genre is slowly becoming mainstream, and it's a huge part of my identity,
that I wanted to share more about me, and the history of Reggaeton.
I implemented stored procedures to customize a sleek interface to keep users engaged.
It allows the user to share with us who their favorite artist is, and with error handling, am able to keep the trolls
that want to enter dummy data away from affecting the data.
The users can search and sort on different categories such as release date, song/album/artist name, country of origin.

I also wanted to show how normal it is for artists in this genre to collaborate on songs with each other.
This is why I created a collaborations tab, to display songs with more than 1 artist. Next version I will organize it neater so it
shows the song name once but all the artists in the song.
